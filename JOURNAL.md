# May 23rd: Finished the PD circuit!

Finished the basic PD circuit with the ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 as the MCU and the STUSB4500 as the PD controller. Got the power regulation and regular setup (BOOT/RESET) for controlling and flashing the MCU working. The current setup uses 2 separate usb C ports, one for PD and one for the MCU.
